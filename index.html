        <p>In my map, I examined the intersection of streams and streets in the Huntersville Business Park. The reason I wanted to look at this topic is because that area is always developing and expanding, so I wanted to see how this development interacts with the location of local streams/creeks. In order to do this, I made a 50-foot buffer for the streams/creeks and streets in the general area of the business park and then created an intersection of those buffers to find where they overlap and thus where streets have been built over streams.</p>
