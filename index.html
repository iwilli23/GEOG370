        <p>The map shows the average cost of living for each county in Maryland based on the national average cost of living. So, a score of 100 would mean that the cost of living is that of the national average. I chose this topic because I am originally from Maryland and have a lot of family in Maryland, so I thought it would be interesting to explore a topic related to that state.</p>
