        <p>For this map, I used the ratio of the number of households in each Virginia county and the total number of households in Virginia (county’s total households / the sum of all of the county’s households). I used this ratio in order to get a sense of population density in the state by seeing where there are the most households. Though I am able to generally see where the most dense counties are, it is difficult to gauge all of the other counties that are not as dense without having a lot more entries in the legend to account for the small ratio differences between each county.</p>

        <p>For this map, I used the ratio of the number of households in each county that use food stamps and the total number of households in the county (use food stamps / county’s total households). I used this ratio to see how many households utilize food stamps out of all of the households in the county in a percentage-like form. The pros of using an equal count (quantile) mode is that the legend values are very easy to digest/understand since they are whole numbers. However, a con would be that the lack of decimal removes some of the minor detailing we are able to see between counties. Another overall con is the need to have a lot more entries in the legend in order to get rid of the large ranges of values (such as 17-33).</p>

        <p>For this map, I used the ratio of the number of households in each county that do not use food stamps and the total number of households in the county (do not use food stamps / county’s total households). Much like the previous map, I used this ratio to see how many households do not utilize food stamps out of all of the households in the county in a percentage-like form. A pro of using the pretty breaks mode is that the distribution between legend entries is neat, which makes the data easy to digest along with the whole numbers. A con would be that, much like the previous map, the lack of decimals removes some of the minor detailing we are able to see between counties.</p>
